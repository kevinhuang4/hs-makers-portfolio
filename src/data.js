        whatHaveILearned:"This is a group project that we worked on during 11th grade. The main theory of how speakers work is through electromagnetic induction, but it is harder to actually make a speaker since there are a lot of components to include. We consulted our teachers and other experts about signal processing and alternating currents and customized our PCB boards from an Elctronics company. It took us another week to assemble the speakers, but one of them did not work. Then, we used multimeter to detect where the problem was on the board. Ultimately, we successfully built our speakers. It was a hard-won but rewarding process in which I gained another experience of turning theories into practices and took me through an essential part in Engineering —— troubleshooting. ",
